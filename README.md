Background
---
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

This new assignment consists of two deliverables:
---
Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook containing code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database.
-
Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook containing code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.

Please note that some portions of my code's structure were inspired by my research on the internet in addition to the hyperlinked module resources emailed to us by Melissa Conner. At the beginning of this boot camp, we were encouraged to be proactive with utilizing the internet as a resource for finding solutions to complex problems that also contributed to our edification. Thus, I was able to formulate my assignment after conducting some independent research on Stack Overflow and Google Search.
